  ## Description
    This week's challenge is to create a text editor that allows the user to install the application on their computer. In order to do so, we must first run `npm install` because there are several dependencies we must install such as webpack, babel, express, nodemon and a few others. After installing the dependencies, we must build the application. We run `npm run build` and from there a dist folder is generated with the necessary components like the manifest.json. After the dist folder is created, we can run `npm run start` to run the application, and if we navigate to the localhost:3000 from our local browser, we can see that JATE loads up and we are able to install the application to our computer. If the user doesn't have internet connection, they can still use the application normally, and the contents of the page will save to the DOM window.
